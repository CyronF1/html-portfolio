<h2> My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Charlie's Angels </h3>
<p> I love how the ladies/angels fight against their enemies. This movie definitely inspired me to become one of the angels.</p>
<h3>Dead or Alive</h3>
<p> This is another movie that revolves around girls who can fight. I am so in love with the action scenes and left me wanting to learn martial arts.</p>
<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
<p>An amazing film that warms one's heart. This movie depicts the hardship encountered black women in NASA and how they strived to overcome racism.</p>
